    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is a sentiment analysis using Twitter data centered around the 2016 Presidential election. We aim to analyze geotagged tweets from different states in the United States to determine how happy or unhappy each state is. In addition, we aim to explore how the sentiment of each state compares to its political leanings and see if there were any changes before and after the election."

    "## Data Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "To scrape the data from Twitter we used [Twint](https://github.com/haccer/twint), (Twitter Intelligence Tool), an advanced Twitter scraper that allowed us to fetch tweets for specific time periods and tweets that related to specific topics and trends. The benefits of using Twint as opposed to Twitter's API are that Twitter's API only allows users to fetch tweets from the past 7 days and limits the number of tweets to 3200 tweets. Twint allows users to fetch almost all tweets and can fetch tweets from any time period. In addition, Twint is not rate limited and does not require a Twitter account.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to collect tweets from 6 months before the 2016 Presidential election and 6 months after the election. In addition, we filtered all the tweets and only included ones which contained the word \"election\" in order to analyze the political sentiment within the tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of the code used to extract all tweets sent 6 months before the election from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We used this code to extract tweets from each state both before and after the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the output, some users include a location on their profile to indicate where they are from. For the purposes of our analysis, however, we chose to use the location from which the user sent the tweet as the user's location. Thus, only tweets for which the geotagged location was available were included."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it appears that the majority of states' sentiment values increased after the Presidential election. The states whose values decreased are mostly located in the northwestern region of the United States. These are states whose sentiment values were very high before the election. Among the states whose sentiment values increased, most increased by a small amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "West Virginia has the most positive change in sentiment value while Montana had the most negative change. Both of these states voted largely Republican in the election. In general, there does not appear to be any relationship with political inclination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "A little over 1 percent of Twitter users have geolocation turned on which enables us to see the exact location from which they send their tweets. Because of this, we were unable to obtain a representative sample of users from each state. Additionally, only 24 percent of online adults use Twitter. Twitter users are generally younger and only 13 percent of people aged 50 to 65 use Twitter. This also affects the results as many people who use Twitter are not of voting age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important fact to consider is that sentiment analysis is difficult when evaluating tweets with sarcasm and other paralinguistic features."
